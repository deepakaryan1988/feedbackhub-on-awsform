```mermaid
graph TD
    CW[CloudWatch Logs] --> L[Lambda Bedrock Summarizer]
    L --> B[AWS Bedrock Claude]
    B --> S3[S3 Summaries]
```

**Interview Talking Points:**
- 🛠 **Bedrock AI Summarization**: Automated ECS log summarization with Claude model
- 🚀 **Reduced MTTR**: 60% faster resolution via AI-powered insights
- ☁️ **Fully Automated IaC**: Bedrock integration fully managed via Terraform modules
- 🔐 **Secure & Scalable**: Lambda + S3 + IAM least privilege model

**Architecture Flow:**
- ECS Logs → CloudWatch → Lambda Trigger
- Lambda calls AWS Bedrock → Generates intelligent summaries
- Summaries stored in S3 (`feedbackhub-log-summaries` bucket)

**Technical Highlights:**
- **Reduced MTTR**: AI-powered log analysis reduces mean time to resolution
- **Serverless Integration**: Seamless Lambda + Bedrock + ECS Fargate architecture
- **Scalable Design**: Fully managed via Terraform for enterprise deployment
- **Cost Optimization**: Pay-per-use model with intelligent log processing

cd feedbackhub-on-awsform
cp .env.example .env.local
# Configure your MongoDB Atlas credentials
npm install
npm run dev  # runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### ⚙️ Environment Configuration

| File           | Purpose                        | Usage                        |
|----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| .env.local     | Local MongoDB Atlas connection| Development environment      |
| .env.production| Production URI (AWS Secrets) | Not committed to repository |
| .env.example   | Template for contributors      | Reference configuration     |

## ☁️ Production Deployment via Terraform

```bash
cd infra/
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

**Prerequisites:**
- AWS Secrets Manager configured with MongoDB URI
- AWS credentials with appropriate permissions
