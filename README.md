# FeedbackHub-on-AWSform

> üíº **Recruiter Note:** This project is a production-grade DevOps showcase integrating Terraform, ECS Fargate, AI (Bedrock Claude), Lambda, and CI/CD. It demonstrates my ability to design and deploy modern cloud architectures, optimize operations, and implement AI-powered observability pipelines.

> **FeedbackHub is a production-ready, cloud-native feedback microservice. Built to teach (and learn) modern, secure, cloud DevOps from code to dashboards.**

**FeedbackHub** is a fullstack Next.js app using MongoDB Atlas. It supports both:
- üß™ Local development (connects directly to MongoDB Atlas via `feedbackhub‚Äëlocal` user)
- ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS production deployment on ECS (via `feedbackhub` user), with Terraform and AWS Secrets Manager

## üöÄ Phase 3: AWS Bedrock Log Summarizer Integration

FeedbackHub now integrates **AWS Bedrock (Claude model)** to automatically summarize ECS logs and store summaries in S3 for quick debugging and analytics.

**Architecture:**
- ECS Logs ‚Üí CloudWatch ‚Üí Lambda Trigger
- Lambda calls AWS Bedrock ‚Üí Generates summary
- Summary stored in S3 (`feedbackhub-log-summaries` bucket)

**Proof of Implementation:**
Screenshots from AWS Console and CLI confirming successful integration:

![AWS Bedrock Web Proof](docs/screenshots/AWS-Bedrock-web-proof.png)

**Interview Prep Highlights:**
- Demonstrates AI-powered observability to reduce MTTR
- Shows serverless + Bedrock integration with ECS Fargate
- Fully managed via Terraform for scalability

**Key Components:**
- **ECS Fargate**: Serverless container orchestration
- **AWS Bedrock**: AI-powered log summarization
- **Lambda**: Serverless event processing
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipeline

## üöÄ Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepakaryan1988/feedbackhub-on-awsform.git
cd feedbackhub-on-awsform
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Atlas credentials if needed
npm install
npm run dev  # runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

| File           | Purpose                        | Usage                        |
|----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| .env.local     | Local MongoDB Atlas connection| Used for NODE_ENV=development|
| .env.production| Atlas Prod URI (in AWS Secrets Manager) | Not committed         |
| .env.example   | Template for contributors      | Commit this only             |

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy to AWS ECS using Terraform

```bash
cd infra/
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

- Ensure AWS Secrets Manager contains:
  ```
  MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/DB_name?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
  ```
- Terraform will configure ECS Task Definition to fetch this secret securely.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation & Health Checks

- **DNS:** Visit the ECS service / Load Balancer URL in browser
- **Health check endpoint:**
  ```bash
  GET /api/health
  # should return status 200 if DB is connected
  ```
- **Logs:**
  ```bash
  aws logs tail /ecs/feedbackhub --since 1h --follow --region ap-south-1 --no-cli-pager
  ```
  Look for:
  - `Connected to MongoDB as feedbackhub`
  - No authentication or DNS errors

---

## üõ° Security Considerations

- `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production` are in `.gitignore`
- Only `.env.example` is committed
- AWS Secrets Manager used for production secrets
- **No credentials or passwords should ever be committed**

---

## üß∞ Troubleshooting

| Issue                        | Solution                                      |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| UI outdated in production    | Force ECS redeploy or verify image version    |
| Feedbacks not showing        | Check CloudWatch logs for MongoDB errors      |
| Form submission fails        | Verify API route logs for runtime/validation  |

## üí° Lessons Learned

### Real-world DevOps Challenges

**Handling ECS container health checks for Next.js required customizing the pipeline and task definition. See [Health Check Documentation](docs/health.md) for detailed lessons learned.**

Key insights from production deployment:
- **Health Check Design**: Next.js apps need specialized health check endpoints
- **Startup Time Management**: Container health checks must account for Next.js startup delays
- **Database Resilience**: Health checks should gracefully handle temporary DB outages
- **Monitoring Integration**: Comprehensive logging and metrics are essential for troubleshooting

### Production Hardening
- **Security**: Implemented least-privilege IAM roles and network security
- **Reliability**: Multiple health check layers and graceful degradation
- **Observability**: Centralized logging with CloudWatch and structured error handling
- **Scalability**: Designed for horizontal scaling with load balancer integration
